### Storyline

**The Long Game: Predicting Success for Scholarship Recipients in Online Education**

Success in online education is more than just completing assignments and passing exams — it’s about adapting to the online learning environment, maintaining motivation, and overcoming barriers to access. This story explores how specific traits, such as adaptability, self-motivation, and access to resources, impact scholarship recipients' ability to succeed in an online educational setting. By analyzing the interplay between financial resources, internet connectivity, and individual adaptability, we aim to predict the likelihood of long-term success, including retention, graduation rates, and post-graduation outcomes. This project provides insights into which factors most influence the success of students who are awarded scholarships for their online education journey.
