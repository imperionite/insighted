    "# Meal Allowance Optimization: Price, Inflation and Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Employee meal allowances are essential elements of compensation packages](https://www.hubengage.com/employee-experience/significance-and-impact-of-employee-allowances/), directly influencing employee satisfaction and well-being. However, [fluctuating food prices and inflation can challenge the maintenance of their real value](https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/flagships/all-things-work/the-wage-inflation-challenge----balancing-business-sustainabilit). This project [addresses the need for a data-driven approach to optimize MotorPH's employee meal allowance, ensuring its continued adequacy and relevance](https://business.doordash.com/en-us/resources/research-shows-meal-benefits-improve-employee-satisfaction). By leveraging [historical food price data and economic indicators, the study provides actionable insights and recommendations](https://psa.gov.ph/price-indices/cpi-ir?utm_source=chatgpt.com). The project employs R and Jupyter Lab as powerful tools for data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling, demonstrating their practical utility in solving real-world business challenges.\n",

    "## **Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objectives of this project are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To develop a base meal price model using historical food price data from MotorPH's data repository.\n",
    "- To implement an inflation-adjusted meal allowance model using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and a proxy Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA).\n",
    "- To create a predictive model to forecast future meal costs, enabling proactive budgeting.\n",
    "- To provide data-driven recommendations for optimizing MotorPH's employee meal allowance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Cleaning and Preparation**\n",
    "- Main Dataset: [Food Prices](https://github.com/imperionite/insighted/blob/main/DataCleaning_FoodPrices.ipynb)\n",
    "- Supplementary Dataset: [Employees Record](https://github.com/imperionite/insighted/blob/main/DataCleaning_Employees.ipynb)"
